一、安装Keepalived(基于layer3, 4 & 5交换机制的软件)-基于Redis
1.主节点安装配置keepalived(10.96.28.135)
yum install -y keepalived


vim /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf


! Configuration File for keepalived
 global_defs { router_id redis44
}
vrrp_script chk_redis {
	script "/etc/keepalived/scripts/redis_check.sh 127.0.0.1 6379 123456"
	interval 2 
	timeout 2 
	fall 3
}

vrrp_instance redis { 
	state BACKUP
	interface bond0 
	virtual_router_id 51 
	priority 100
	nopreempt 
	advert_int 1 
	authentication {
		auth_type PASS
		auth_pass 1111
}

virtual_ipaddress {
	10.96.28.140
} 

track_script {
	chk_redis
	} 
}


mkdir -pv /etc/keepalived/scripts
mkdir -pv /var/log/redis/
vim /etc/keepalived/scripts/redis_check.sh

#!/bin/bash
#
#chkconfig: 2345 80 90
ALIVE=`/usr/bin/redis-cli -h $1 -p $2 -a $3 PING`
LOGFILE="/var/log/redis/keepalived-redis-check.log"
source /etc/init.d/functions

echo "[CHECK]" >> $LOGFILE
date >> $LOGFILE
if [ $ALIVE == "PONG" ];then
	echo "Success: redis-cli -h $1 -p $2 -a no PING $ALIVE" >> $LOGFILE 2>&1 exit 0
else
	echo "Failed:redis-cli -h $1 -p $2 -a no PING $ALIVE " >> $LOGFILE 2>&1 exit 1
fi

dos2unix /etc/keepalived/scripts/redis_check.sh
chmod +x /etc/keepalived/scripts/redis_check.sh

/etc/init.d/keepalived start


2.从节点安装配置keepalived(10.96.28.136)
yum install -y keepalived

vim /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

! Configuration File for keepalived
 global_defs { router_id redis44
}
vrrp_script chk_redis {
	script "/etc/keepalived/scripts/redis_check.sh 127.0.0.1 6379 123456"
	interval 2 
	timeout 2 
	fall 3
}

vrrp_instance redis { 
	state BACKUP
	interface bond0 
	virtual_router_id 51 
	priority 90
	nopreempt 
	advert_int 1 
	authentication {
		auth_type PASS
		auth_pass 1111
}

virtual_ipaddress {
	10.96.28.140
} 
track_script {
	chk_redis
	} 
}


mkdir -pv /etc/keepalived/scripts
mkdir -pv /var/log/redis/
vim /etc/keepalived/scripts/redis_check.sh 

#!/bin/bash
#
#chkconfig: 2345 80 90
ALIVE=`/usr/bin/redis-cli -h $1 -p $2 -a $3 PING`
LOGFILE="/var/log/redis/keepalived-redis-check.log"
source /etc/init.d/functions

echo "[CHECK]" >> $LOGFILE
date >> $LOGFILE
if [ $ALIVE == "PONG" ];then
	echo "Success: redis-cli -h $1 -p $2 -a no PING $ALIVE" >> $LOGFILE 2>&1 exit 0
else
	echo "Failed:redis-cli -h $1 -p $2 -a no PING $ALIVE " >> $LOGFILE 2>&1 exit 1
fi


dos2unix /etc/keepalived/scripts/redis_check.sh
chmod +x /etc/keepalived/scripts/redis_check.sh


/etc/init.d/keepalived start
